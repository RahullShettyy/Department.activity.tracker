ASSIGNMENT PROJECT REPORT

ASSIGNMENT PROJECT NAME: Department Activity Tracker

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background / Problem Context
- The Department Activity Tracker is a specialized web-based application designed to manage and monitor various academic and extracurricular activities within a college department.
- In many educational institutions, tracking event schedules, student registrations, and actual attendance is often done manually or through disconnected spreadsheets.
- This leads to data inconsistency, difficulty in generating reports, and a lack of real-time visibility into department engagement.
- Automating this process ensures that all event-related data is centralized, accessible, and accurate.
- It allows faculty to plan events better and provides students with a clear view of upcoming opportunities.
- The system simplifies the registration process, making it more user-friendly for students.
- It also streamlines the attendance marking process, which is crucial for determining the success of an event.
- Ultimately, this software-driven approach enhances the overall administrative efficiency of the department.

1.2 Motivation
- The motivation for this project stems from the need to apply core backend development concepts using Java and MySQL to a real-world problem.
- Managing academic schedules can be complex, and building a custom solution allows for tailored features that standard tools might lack.
- Personal interest in building lightweight, framework-less Java servers to understand the underlying mechanics of web communication was also a key driver.

1.3 Objectives
- To design a system that automates the tracking of department-level events and student participation.
- To implement a custom Java HTTP server to handle both static content and API requests.
- To apply database management concepts learned in the course using MySQL for persistent storage.
- To create a responsive and modern user interface using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1.4 Scope
- The project covers event creation, scheduling, student registration for specific events, and attendance management.
- It includes a dashboard for real-time statistics like total attendance and event counts.
- It does NOT currently cover multi-user authentication, advanced role-based access control, or external email integrations.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Existing Systems
- Google Forms: Often used for registrations but lacks centralized database integration and automated attendance tracking within a single dashboard.
- Eventbrite: A powerful commercial tool but can be overkill and lacks the specific organizational hierarchy (Departments/Students) required for educational institutions.
- University ERP Systems: Comprehensive but often slow, complex, and difficult to customize for small-scale departmental needs.
- Manual Spreadsheets: The most common fallback, which is prone to human error and data loss.

2.2 Key Concepts
- Java HTTP Server: A built-in Java library used to create a lightweight web server without the overhead of heavy frameworks like Spring or Tomcat.
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): An API for connecting and executing queries on a database, forming the backbone of the data persistence layer.
- DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern: A design pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism.
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern: A software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers, separating the internal representation of information from the ways that information is presented to and accepted from the user.
- RESTful API: A set of architectural constraints for creating Web Services that allow different systems to communicate over HTTP using JSON as the data exchange format.

3. SYSTEM / PROJECT DESIGN
3.1 System Architecture Diagram

                                                               |
                                                               | (JDBC)
                                                               v
                                                         [ MySQL Database ]

3.2 Architecture Explanation
- Client Side: Built with HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It handles user interaction and makes asynchronous API calls.
- Server Side: A lightweight Java application using `com.sun.net.httpserver`. It routes requests to various handlers (Static and API).
- Data Access Layer: Uses the DAO pattern to interact with the MySQL database, ensuring clean separation of business logic and database queries.
- Database: A relational MySQL database storing tables for departments, events, students, and their respective registrations.

3.3 Flowchart / Use Case Diagram
- Start -> User accesses Dashboard -> Request sent to Server -> Server fetches stats from DB -> Stats displayed on UI.
- User selects "Events" -> API request fetches all events -> List rendered on screen.
- User registers for Event -> POST request with student data -> Server validates and saves to `registrations` table -> Confirmation shown.

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
4.1 Technologies Used
- Language: Java 17
- Database: MySQL 8.3
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- Libraries: GSON (JSON parsing), MySQL Connector/J
- Build Tool: Maven

4.2 Dataset Description
- Source: Locally generated and maintained in MySQL.
- Initial Data: The system starts with a pre-populated list of departments (CSE, ISE, Civil, etc.) via `schema.sql`.
- Record Details: 
    - `events`: title, description, date, location, status.
    - `students`: student_id, name, email, department.
    - `registrations`: mapping student to event with attendance status.

4.3 Step-by-Step Implementation
Module 1: Input - Interfaces for creating new events and student registration forms.
Module 2: Processing - Java handlers parsing JSON data, DAO objects performing SQL insertions and updates.
Module 3: Output - Dynamic dashboard metrics, event lists, and attendance reports.

4.4 Code Snippets
- Main Server Setup:
  server.createContext("/api", new ApiHandler()); // Routes all /api paths to a custom handler.
- Event DAO Insertion:
  String sql = "INSERT INTO events (title, description, event_date, location, department_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
  // Uses PreparedStatement for security against SQL injection.

5. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
5.1 Output Screenshots
(Note: In the final PDF version, insert screenshots of Dashboard, Events List, and Create Event form here.)

5.2 Result Explanation
- The system successfully allows administrators to create events which are immediately visible on the dashboard and events page.
- Registration logic correctly associates students with events and prevents duplicate entries for the same student in the same event.
- Attendance can be toggled in real-time, and the dashboard stats reflect these changes dynamically.

5.3 Advantages
- Lightweight: No complex frameworks required to run.
- Accurate: Real-time database updates ensure data integrity.
- Scalable: The modular Java structure allows for easy addition of new features.
- User-Friendly: Responsive UI works across different screen sizes.

5.4 Limitations
- Security: Lacks password protection for the administrative dashboard.
- Localhost: Currently configured for local development and not yet deployed on a public server.
- Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented; more robust validation could be added.

5.5 Future Enhancements
- User Authentication: Add Login/Signup for faculty and students.
- Notifications: Implement email or SMS alerts for upcoming events.
- Reports: Add functionality to export attendance lists as PDF or Excel.
- Mobile App: Create a mobile interface for easier attendance marking on the go.
